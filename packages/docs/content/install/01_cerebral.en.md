## Cerebral

To install Cerebral you need to use the Node Package Manager. NPM is part of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please install that on your computer first. You should install Node version 5 or later. If you are not familiar with Node and/or Webpack it can be a good idea to start out with [the tutorial](../tutorial/01_introduction.html). You should also install [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (it is used instead of `npm` in the latest `create-app-react`)

`npm install -g yarn`

To install Cerebral Alpha you have to explicitly install Cerebral and its dependency:

`yarn add cerebral@next function-tree@next`
