title: Function Tree

## Function Tree
You might want to use the low level [function-tree](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral/tree/master/packages/function-tree) project, which Cerebral wraps. Especially on the server, function-tree and its debugger will help you express complex logic and debug it.

`npm install function-tree@next --save --save-exact`

### Debugger
Function tree currently only has a standalone debugger for [Mac](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1pYKovu9UpybFc1YUxOT3JlaVE), [Windows](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1pYKovu9UpyUWt6SHM5N2xYYnc) and [Linux](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1pYKovu9UpybzVJWjVpRk9OTjg).
