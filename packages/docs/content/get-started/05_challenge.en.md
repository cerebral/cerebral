## Challenge

So now you have gotten quick insight into the core concepts of Cerebral. To encourage you to wield some of your own code we want to give you a challenge.

Implement a button that will toggle an **isUpperCase** state. Use this state to show the text as upper case or lower case in the component. You can use the **toggle('state:someState')** operator to toggle the state.

To look at a solution you can checkout a branch in the repo:

`git checkout solution`

Or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
