## Get started

If you want to get your hands dirty right away you can follow this "get started" tutorial, or you can move on to learn more about the concepts of Cerebral in the next section.

Make sure you fulfill these requirements:

* You have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 4 or later
* You are okay with learning Cerebral using React and JSX. You can choose something else for your own project later though
* You have a coffee or a beer, ready to learn something new

Okay, lets get going. First you need to clone the tutorial repo.

`git clone https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-website-tutorial.git`

Or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Starting the project
The tutorial runs on [react-create-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) by Facebook. To run it, go to the project folder and install the dependencies, including Cerebral by running:

`npm install`

After you are done you can fire up the project with:

`npm start`

Go to *localhost:3000* and "Hello world!" should appear in the browser.

### Installing the debugger
The Cerebral debugger is a Chrome extension. You can install it from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cerebral-debugger/ddefoknoniaeoikpgneklcbjlipfedbb). Once the debugger is installed your Chrome devtools will have a new tab called **cerebral2**. Open it.
