## Get started

If you want to install Cerebral into an existing project please...

`npm install cerebral`

...and then move on to the other docs.

If you want an introduction you can keep reading and go through a small demo project. Just make sure you fulfill these requirements:

* You have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 4 or later
* You are okay with learning Cerebral using React and JSX. You can choose something else for your own project later though
* You have a coffee or a beer, ready to learn something new

Okay, lets get going. First you need to clone the tutorial repo.

`git clone https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-website-tutorial.git`

Or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Starting the project
The tutorial runs on [react-create-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) by Facebook. To run it, go to the project folder and install the dependencies, including Cerebral by running:

`npm install`

After you are done you can fire up the project with:

`npm start`

Go to *localhost:3000* and "Hello world!" should appear in the browser.

### Installing the debugger
The Cerebral debugger is a Chrome extension. You can install it from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cerebral-debugger/ddefoknoniaeoikpgneklcbjlipfedbb). Once the debugger is installed your Chrome devtools will have a new tab called **cerebral2**. Open it.
