## Install

To install Cerebral you need to use the Node Package Manager. NPM is part of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please install that on your computer first.

If you are not familiar with Node and/or Webpack it can be a good idea to start out with the tutorial and then use [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) as a starting point for your new Cerebral project.

To actually install Cerebral, run this in your project folder:

`npm install cerebral@next --save`
