## Install

To install Cerebral you need to use the Node Package Manager. NPM is part of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please install that on your computer first. You should install Node version 5 or later. If you are not familiar with Node and/or Webpack it can be a good idea to start out with [the tutorial](../tutorial/01_introduction.html).

To install Cerebral, run the following in your project root:

`npm install cerebral@next --save`

If you are just testing out Cereral it can be an idea to use [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) as a starting point.
