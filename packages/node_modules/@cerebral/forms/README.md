## DEPRECATED

Forms are one of the most complex state management challenges out there. Before Cerebral was created I spent a lot of time developing [formsy-react](https://github.com/formsy/formsy-react), which is a library that tries to solve forms with internal state. With the release of Cerebral we got a chance to explore the space of solving forms complexity with external state instead. Initially the solution was interesting as Cerebral exposed that actual state of the form in the debugger. But that goes against the idea of a form state being derived of its value. The iterations has just led us down a rabbit hole of difficult APIs to understand and hiding the actual state of the form in computeds, loosing any benefits.

Forms in Cerebral are like any other form solutions. It is treated as a complex input that handles validations etc. There are many solutions to this, including [formsy-react](https://github.com/formsy/formsy-react).
