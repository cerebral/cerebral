## Documentation

* [Current Cerebral (2.x and up)](http://www.cerebraljs.com/)
* [Previous Cerebral (1.x)](http://cerebral-website.herokuapp.com/)

## Contribute
The entire Cerebral codebase has been rewritten to encourage contributions. The code is cleaned up, commented and all code is in a "monorepo". That means you can run tests across projects and general management of the code is simplified a lot.

1. Clone the monorepo: `git clone https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral.git`
2. In root: `npm install`

The packages are located under `packages` folder and there is **no need** to run `npm install` for each package.

### Using monorepo for your own apps
If you want to use Cerebral 2 directly from your cloned repo, you can create a symlinks for following
directories into the `node_modules` directory of your app:
* `packages/node_modules/cerebral`
* `packages/node_modules/function-tree`
* `packages/node_modules/@cerebral`

If your app and the cerebral monorepo are in the same folder you can do from inside your
app directory:

```sh
$ ln -s ../../cerebral/packages/node_modules/cerebral/ node_modules/
# ...
```

Just remember to unlink the package before installing it from npm:

```sh
$ unlink node_modules/cerebral
# ...
```

### Running demos
Go to the respective `packages/demos/some-demo-folder` and run `npm start`

### Testing
You can run all tests in all packages from root:

`npm test`

Or you can run tests for specific packages by going to package root and do the same:

`npm test`

### Changing the code
When you make a code change you should create a branch first. When the code is changed and backed up by a test you can commit it from **the root** using:

`npm run commit`

This will give you a guide to creating a commit message. Then you just push and create a pull request as normal on Github.
