## Cerebral v1 is the current official release. Documentation is available at:
[https://www.cerebraljs.com/](http://www.cerebraljs.com/).

## Cerebral v2 is still a work in progress. Please head over to our cerebral v2 WIP website for more information:
[https://cerebral.github.io/](https://cerebral.github.io/).

## Try out Cerebral 2
To try out Cerebral 2 you can install any package with:

`npm install {cerebralPackage}@next --save --save-exact`

This will install the latest version of that package. New versions are automatically deployed whenever pull requests are merged into master.

When you want to update your packages you **have to update all used packages in one go**, for example:

`npm install cerebral@next cerebral-router@next cerebral-provider-http@next --save --save-exact`

## Contribute
The entire Cerebral codebase has been rewritten to encourage contributions. The code is cleaned up, commented and all code is in a "monorepo". That means you can run tests across projects and general management of the code is simplified a lot.

1. Clone the monorepo: `git clone https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral.git`
2. In root: `npm install`
3. Run `npm run setup:packages` which will build packages source code and link it together
4. Run `npm run setup` if you need to set up whole repo (docs, demos, tutorials, debuggers)

The packages are located under `packages` folder and there is **no need** to run `npm install` for each package.

### Using monorepo for your own apps
If you want to use Cerebral 2 directly from your cloned repo, you can create a symlink
to the `packages/cerebral` directory into the `node_modules` directory of your app.

If your app and the cerebral monorepo are in the same folder you can do from inside your
app directory:

```sh
$ ln -s ../../cerebral/packages/cerebral/ node_modules/
```

Similar you can link other packages from the `packages` directory into your app's
`node_modules` folder.

Just remember to unlink the package before installing it from npm:

```sh
$ unlink node_modules/cerebral
```

### Running demos
Go to the respective `demos/some-demo-folder` and run `npm start`

### Testing
You can run all tests in all packages from root:

`npm test`

Or you can run tests for specific packages by going to package root and do the same:

`npm test`

### Changing the code
When you make a code change you should create a branch first. When the code is changed and backed up by a test you can commit it from **the root** using:

`npm run commit`

This will give you a guide to creating a commit message. Then you just push and create a pull request as normal on Github.
