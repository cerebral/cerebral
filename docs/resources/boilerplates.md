# Boilerplates

## create-react-app

Facebook released a boilerplating tool for React, called [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html). As a beginner it can be a good idea to create a project with create-react-app first and install Cerebral as instructed in [Install Cerebral](/docs/introduction/install.html).

Various scripts that uses [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html), yarn and some shell script to start a cerebral project based on cerebral's official examples: tutorial, demo, forms-demo and todomvc. (_tested on Linux, may work on Mac_)
