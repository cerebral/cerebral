# Signal

Signals are just arrays:

```js
export default []
```

You populate these arrays with actions:

```js
export default [
  someAction,
  set(state`foo`, 'bar')
]
```

You can attach signals at the controller level:

```js
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import somethingHappened from './signals/somethingHappened'

const Controller({
  signals: {
    somethingHappened
  }
})
```

Or you can attach them to modules:

```js
import somethingHappened from './signals/somethingHappened'

export default {
  signals: {
    somethingHappened
  }
}
```

```js
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import app from './modules/app'

const Controller({
  modules: {
    app
  }
})
```

## Async
By default signals run completely synchronous, but an action might run asynchronously thus making the signal async. When an action returns a promise it means it runs async.

```js
function myAction () {
  return Promise.resolve()
}
```

You could also use an **async** function:

```js
async function myAction () {
  return {foo: 'bar'}
}
```

## Sequence
Simple format of a sequence is to use an array literal, as explained above. Actions are run one after the other. If the action returns a promise Cerebral will wait until it resolves before moving to the next action:

```js
import someAction from '../actions/someAction'

export default [
  someAction
]
```

The array is converted to a sequence, but you can also be explicit about it:
```js
import {sequence} from 'cerebral'
import someAction from '../actions/someAction'

export default sequence([
  someAction
])
```

You can name a sequence, which will be displayed in debugger:
```js
import {sequence} from 'cerebral'
import someAction from '../actions/someAction'

export default sequence('my sequence', [
  someAction
])
```

You can compose a sequence into existing sequence. The debugger will show this composition:
```js
import someAction from '../actions/someAction'
import someOtherSequence from './someOtherSequence'

export default [
  someAction,
  someOtherSequence
]
```

## Parallel
Cerebral can not truly run actions in parallel (JavaScript is single threaded), but it can trigger multiple asynchronous actions at the same time, just like **Promise.all**. That means when Cerebral triggers actions defined within a parallel, it will not wait if a promise is returned, it will just move on to the next action. When all actions within a parallel is resolved it will move to the action after the parallel definition, if any:

```js
import {parallel} from 'cerebral'
import someAsyncAction from '../actions/someAsyncAction'
import someOtherAsyncAction from '../actions/someOtherAsyncAction'

export default parallel([
  someAsyncAction,
  someOtherAsyncAction
])
```

You can name a parallel, which will be displayed in debugger:
```js
import {parallel} from 'cerebral'
import someAsyncAction from '../actions/someAsyncAction'
import someOtherAsyncAction from '../actions/someOtherAsyncAction'

export default parallel('my parallel', [
  someAsyncAction,
  someOtherAsyncAction
])
```

You can compose parallel into any existing sequence:
```js
import {parallel} from 'cerebral'
import someAction from '../actions/someAction'
import someAsyncAction from '../actions/someAsyncAction'
import someOtherAsyncAction from '../actions/someOtherAsyncAction'

export default [
  someAction,
  parallel('my parallel', [
    someAsyncAction,
    someOtherAsyncAction
  ])
]
```

## Paths
You can diverge execution by defining paths in your signal.

```js
export default [
  httpGet('/items'), {
    success: [],
    error: []
  }
]
```

The action returned by **httpGet** will now have access to a success and an error path and can call those based on the result of the http request.

You can define any path to execute:

```js
export default [
  myAction, {
    foo: [],
    bar: [],
    bananas: [],
    apples: []
  }
]
```

When these paths are defined you will have access to corresponding paths in the action preceding the paths:

```js
function myAction ({path}) {
  path.foo
  path.bar
  path.bananas
  path.apples
}
```

To actually diverge down the path you have to call it and return it from the action:

```js
function myAction ({path}) {
  return path.foo()
}
```

Optionally pass a payload:

```js
function myAction ({path}) {
  return path.bananas({foo: 'bar'})
}
```

With promises you just return it the same way:

```js
function myAction ({someProvider, path}) {
  return someProvider.doAsync()
    .then((result) => path.bananas({data: result.data}))
}
```

## Errors
You can catch specific errors on a signal.

```js
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import somethingHappened from './signals/somethingHappened'
import httpFailed from './signals/httpFailed'
import {HttpProviderError} from 'cerebral-provider-http'

const Controller({
  signals: {
    somethingHappened: {
      signal: somethingHappened,
      catch: new Map([
        [HttpProviderError, httpFailed]
      ])
    }
  }
})
```
