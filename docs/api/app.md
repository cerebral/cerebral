# App

```js
import App from 'cerebral'
import main from './main' // The main module

const app = App(main, {
  // The devtools
  devtools: null,
  // Also logs error handling to console.
  throwToConsole: true,
  // A map of state changes to run before instantiation,
  // where the key is the path and value is the state value
  stateChanges: {}
})
```

## Methods

### getState

Returns state from the state tree

```js
const someState = app.getState('some.state')
```

### getSequence

Returns sequence from Cerebral

```js
const someSequence = app.getSequence('some.sequence')
// Run sequence
someSequence({ foo: 'bar' })
```

### getModel

Returns the model (state tree) of Cerebral

```js
const model = app.getModel()
```

### flush

Flushes out changes to UI based on recent state changes, can be forced

```js
app.flush()
```

### runSequence

Allows you to run an arbitrary function tree definition

```js
app.runSequence('someSequence', [actionA, actionB], { foo: 'bar' })
```

### addModule

Allows you to add modules to the app after instantiation (lazy)

```js
app.addModule('someModule', module)
```

### removeModule

Allows you to remove modules from the app

```js
app.removeModule('someModule')
```

### parallelStart

Triggered whenever Cerebral executes actions in parallel.

```js
app.on(
  'parallelStart',
  (execution, payload, functionsToResolveCount) => {}
)
```

### parallelProgress

Triggered whenever Cerebral executes actions in parallel.

```js
app.on(
  'parallelProgress',
  (execution, payload, functionsStillResolvingCount) => {}
)
```

### parallelEnd

Triggered whenever Cerebral ends executing actions in parallel.

```js
app.on('parallelEnd', (execution, payload, functionsExecutedCount) => {})
