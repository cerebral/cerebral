# Introduction

Open source would never work without contributions, but it is difficult to get a sense of where you can put in an effort to help out on a project. Where is help needed? How does the project work? How do I create a pull request? On this page you will hopefully get the information you need to contribute to the Cerebral project.

## Contribute to documentation

Contributing with missing explanations and wrong documentation is the **most important** contribution you can make to any project.

## Contribute to website

New documentation like guides is a really great way to contribute as it will help others with specific use cases.

## Contribute to codebase

Bug fixes, refactors, typescript typings and new features is also a really great way to contribute. Mostly because you get insight into the code and get more ownership.
