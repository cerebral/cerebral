## Snapshot testing (beta)

Snapshot testing allows you to use the Cerebral debugger to create your tests. Just trigger a signal in your application, select it in the debugger and click "Create signal test". The test will now run the signal as normal with mocked providers. Any provider usage and mutations related to the original signal execution is handled by the test.
