# Function Tree
You might want to use the low level [function-tree](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral/tree/master/packages/function-tree) project, which Cerebral wraps. Especially on the server, function-tree and its debugger will help you express complex logic and debug it.

`npm install function-tree@next --save`

### Debugger
Use the Cerebral standalone debugger configured with function-tree.
