# Introduction

The Cerebral tutorial uses [Webpackbin](https://www.webpackbin.com). Webpackbin is actually built with Cerebral as well, giving you an opportunity to see what kind of applications you can build with it.

We **highly recommend** to install the **standalone** Cerebral debugger before starting the tutorial. This will allow you to explore Cerebral using the debugger while going through the tutorial. If you prefer the Chrome extension, you will be free to use that on your own local projects.
