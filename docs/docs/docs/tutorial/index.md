# Introduction

The Cerebral tutorial uses [Webpackbin](https://www.webpackbin.com). Webpackbin is actually built using Cerebral and it's a great demonstration of a complex application that has been developed using the Cerebral framework.

We **highly recommend** that you install the **standalone** Cerebral debugger before starting the tutorial. This will allow you to explore Cerebral using the debugger while going through the tutorial. If you prefer the Chrome extension, you will be free to use that on your own local projects.
