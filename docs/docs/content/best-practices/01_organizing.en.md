## Organizing

Cerebral uses a concept called **modules** to organize application code. These allow you to wrap state and signals into a namespace without isolating them. Any action run in a signal can change any state in the application.

Typically the file structure for modules looks like this. We call it the **chains pattern**. This is where a signal points to one or multiple chains when they are defined:

```js
/modules
  /home
    /actions
    /chains
    index.js
main.js
```

```js
import doThis from './chains/doThis'

export default {
  signals: {
    somethingHappened: doThis
  }
}
```

The **signals** pattern looks like this:

```js
/modules
  /home
    /actions
    /signals
    index.js
main.js
```

```js
import somethingHappened from './signals/somethingHappened'

export default {
  signals: {
    somethingHappened
  }
}
```

There is no "correct way" to do this, do what makes sense to you and your team.


In the **main.js** file, the module is added to the controller:

```js
import {Controller} from 'cerebral'
import home from './modules/home'

const controller = Controller({
  modules: {
    home
  }
})
```

Any signal and state defined inside the *home* module will live on the namespace chosen during controller instantiation. In the example above, this is: **home**.

The *modules/home/index.js* typically looks like this:

```js
import updateLatestPosts from './chains/updateLatestPosts'

export default {
  state: {
    latestPosts: []
  },
  signals: {
    mounted: updateLatestPosts
  }
}
```

And this is how an application scales: by defining modules and submodules. Actions or chains that are common are often placed in a folder called **common**:

```js
/common
  /actions
  /chains
/modules
  /home
    /actions
    /chains
    index.js
main.js
```

### Components

A very important point in Cerebral is that your components do not affect the structure of the application state. Modules are defined in terms of what makes sense for state and signals. Sometimes this is similar to how components are structured, but more often it is not. This is why components usually live in their own **components** folder, separated from the modules:

```js
/components
  /Home
    index.js
/common
  /actions
  /chains
/modules
  /home
    /actions
    /chains
    index.js
main.js
```

And this is it. You will never get in trouble creating a module because any action can change any state in your application. Modules are just a way to structure state and signals, not isolate them.
