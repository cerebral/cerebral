# Typescript

Although Cerebral does provide type definitions, it is encouraged to use the [@cerebral/fluent](/docs/addons/fluent) addon. This package exposes a signals API that gives you full type safety. It also uses [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management, meaning you get type safety and auto suggestions throughout your whole app as well.

Read through [the Typescript guide](/docs/guides/typescript) to learn more about how it works!
