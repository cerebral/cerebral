## From the browser

Open [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/m59vpm64vx). The debugger application will only work if you are running Codesandbox with **Chrome**. This is because Chrome allows connecting from a public domain to localhost. Locally on your machine you can use any browser.

## Install on my machine

1.  Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), the JavaScript Runtime
2.  Open [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/m59vpm64vx)
3.  Hit the **download** button and unzip the project to a folder
4.  Run `npm install` and then `npm start`
