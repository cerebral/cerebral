# Providers

Providers are added to the context of every action executed by a signal. Providers can be everything from a tool you are already using, to something Cerebral specific. **The point of providers is to separate side effects from execution**. That means you can create all the logic you want in actions without creating any dependencies to other tools. This makes them highly testable and generally gives you more flexibility.

## The default providers
Cerebral has a set of default providers:

- **props** - The data passed into execution and/or returned from actions
- **state** - The API that changes the state of your application
- **controller** - Access to the controller instance inside an action
- **resolve** - Ability to resolve tags and computed inside actions

All these can be accessed inside an action:

```js
function someAction ({props, state, controller, resolve}) {}
```

The [devtools](/introduction/devtools) also adds its own provider called **debugger**.

## Adding a provider
If you are using libraries where you want access to everything they provide you can simply add them as a provider using an object:

```js
import {Controller, provide} from 'cerebral'
import axios from 'axios'
import uuid from 'uuid'

const controller = Controller({
  providers: [
    provide('http', axios),
    provide('id', uuid.v4)
  ]
})
```

Note that some tools has a very complex API that is difficult for Cerebral to analyze. With these kinds of tools it is a better idea to create your own provider, exposing APIs that you actually use from the original tool.

## Creating a provider
You can use providers for pretty much anything, though typically it is to handle some kind of side effect. Examples of providers is [@cerebral/storage](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral/tree/master/packages/storage), [@cerebral/firebase](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral/tree/master/packages/firebase) and [@cerebral/http](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral/tree/master/packages/http).

To use a provider with Cerebral you put it in the providers array:

```js
const controller = Controller({
  providers: [
    StorageProvider(),
    HttpProvider(),
    FirebaseProvider()
  ]
})
```

The **provide** factory helps you add your own providers in a simple way:

```js
import {Controller, provide} from 'cerebral'

const controller = Controller({
  providers: [
    provide('someProvider', {
      returnFoo() {
        return 'foo'
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

When using the **provide** factory the provider will automatically be wrapped by the Cerebral devtools, to track its usage in the debugger.

Now this provider is available to any action:

```js
function myAction ({someProvider}) {
  someProvider.returnFoo() // "foo"
}
```

Play around with creating a provider on [this BIN](https://www.webpackbin.com/bins/-KpZNE-A-_O7hjIGqVnL).

As mentioned above we use providers to separate side effects from execution, allowing us to provide our own custom API to our application. The **provide** factory simplifies adding a provider, but you can get more control by defining your own provider function. [Look at the API docs for more information](/docs/api/providers).
