# Install
To install Cerebral you need to use the Node Package Manager. NPM is part of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please install that on your computer first. You should install Node version 5 or later. If you are not familiar with Node and/or Webpack it can be a good idea to start out with [the tutorial](/docs/developer_guide/index.html).

To install Cerebral BETA you have to explicitly install Cerebral and its dependency:

**NPM**

`npm install cerebral@next --save --save-exact`

**YARN**

`yarn add cerebral@next --exact`
